**IMPORTANT**: Copy and paste these instructions at the start of any conversation with an AI assistant about the EquipIQ project.

## For All AI Assistants

```
This is the EquipIQ project. Please:

1. READ the current project status:
   https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/blob/main/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

2. CHECK what's already done:
   https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/blob/main/PROGRESS.md

3. USE tested prompts from:
   https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/blob/main/PROMPTS.md

4. After our session, UPDATE or tell me what to update in:
   - PROGRESS.md - What we accomplished
   - PROMPTS.md - New prompts that worked
   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Issues we fixed

Do NOT create new documentation files. Use the existing ones listed above.
```

## For AI with GitHub Access (Claude, Claude Code)

```
You have access to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq

Please:
1. Read all .md files in the root directory
2. Update PROGRESS.md after making changes
3. Add successful prompts to PROMPTS.md
4. Document fixes in TROUBLESHOOTING.md

```

## For AI without GitHub Write Access (ChatGPT, Gemini)

```
Please read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/main/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

At the end of our session, provide updates for me to add to:
- PROGRESS.md - Tasks completed
- PROMPTS.md - Successful commands
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Problems solved

Format your updates clearly so I can copy/paste them.
```

## For Lovable.dev

Include in your prompts:
```
See PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for project details.
Update PROGRESS.md after completing these changes.
Add this prompt to PROMPTS.md if it works well.
```

## Documentation File Purposes

- **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Project overview, don't update unless major changes
- **PROGRESS.md** - Update after EVERY work session
- **PROMPTS.md** - Add new working prompts
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Add new issues and solutions
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Summary guide, rarely needs updates

## Key Information

- **No coding experience** - Owner needs simple language
- **Using Lovable.dev** - AI-powered development platform
- **Tanning salon industry** - Multi-location equipment management
- **Current focus** - Fix import errors, create ticket UI, dashboard real data

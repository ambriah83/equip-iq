# AI Assistant Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Copy and paste these instructions at the start of any conversation with an AI assistant about the EquipIQ project.

**UPDATE REMINDER**: After any work session, run `./update-reminder.sh` for a checklist of documentation to update.

## For All AI Assistants

```
This is the EquipIQ project. Please:

1. READ the current project status:
   https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/blob/main/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

2. CHECK what's already done:
   https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/blob/main/PROGRESS.md

3. USE tested prompts from:
   https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/blob/main/PROMPTS.md

4. **CRITICAL**: After EVERY work session:
   - If you can write to files: UPDATE these files directly
   - If you cannot write: Tell me exactly what to update
   - PROGRESS.md - What we accomplished (with date and who made changes)
   - PROMPTS.md - New prompts that worked
   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Issues we fixed

Do NOT create new documentation files. Use the existing ones listed above.
Always update PROGRESS.md - this is how we track all changes across AI tools!
```

## For AI with GitHub Access (Claude, Claude Code)

```
You have access to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/ambriah83/equip-iq

Please:
1. Read all .md files in the root directory
2. DIRECTLY UPDATE these files after making changes:
   - PROGRESS.md - Add what you accomplished (with date)
   - PROMPTS.md - Add new working prompts
   - TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Add fixes you implemented
3. Always include who made the update (e.g., "by Claude Code", "by Lovable")
4. Keep all documentation current
```

## For AI without GitHub Write Access (ChatGPT, Gemini)

```
Please read: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ambriah83/equip-iq/main/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

At the end of our session, provide updates for me to add to:
- PROGRESS.md - Tasks completed
- PROMPTS.md - Successful commands
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Problems solved

Format your updates clearly so I can copy/paste them.
```

## For Lovable.dev

Include in your prompts:
```
See PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for project details.
IMPORTANT: After completing changes, update these files:
- PROGRESS.md - Add what was accomplished today (with date)
- PROMPTS.md - Add this prompt if it worked well
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Add any fixes implemented
```

## Documentation File Purposes

- **PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** - Project overview, don't update unless major changes
- **PROGRESS.md** - Update after EVERY work session
- **PROMPTS.md** - Add new working prompts
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Add new issues and solutions
- **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Summary guide, rarely needs updates

## Key Information

- **No coding experience** - Owner needs simple language
- **Using Lovable.dev** - AI-powered development platform
- **Tanning salon industry** - Multi-location equipment management
- **Current focus** - Fix import errors, create ticket UI, dashboard real data

## GitHub Repository

Always check existing documentation before creating anything new!

# AI Chatbot Status and Architecture

## Current State (as of today)

### What We Just Did
1. **Consolidated AI chat components** into a single enhanced `AIChatGPTSecure.tsx`
2. **Added multimedia features**: Image upload, video upload, live video calls, and feedback system
3. **Deleted unused components**: `AIChat.tsx` and `AIChatGPT.tsx` from main app
4. **Updated routing**: Both 'ai-chat' and 'ai-chatgpt' now use `AIChatGPTSecure`

### Remaining Structure

#### Main App AI Chat
- **Location**: `/src/components/AIChatGPTSecure.tsx`
- **Features**: 
  - Secure ChatGPT integration via Netlify functions
  - Image/video upload support
  - Live video call functionality
  - User feedback system
  - Uses GPT-4o-mini model
- **Route**: `/ai-chat` and `/ai-chatgpt` in main app

#### Gemini Prototype (REMOVED)
- **Status**: Deleted - prototype has been removed from the codebase
- **Reason**: Main app now has all features, prototype was causing conflicts

### Key Technical Details
- **API Key**: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- **Backend**: Netlify function at `/.netlify/functions/chat` for secure API calls
- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini

### Recommendations for Other Claude

#### If Port Conflicts Occur:
1. **Check running processes**: Only one app can use port 8080
2. **Prototype interference**: The gemini-prototype might be causing routing conflicts

#### Solutions:
1. **Option A - Disable Prototype**: Comment out prototype routes or disable it entirely
2. **Option B - Different Port**: Move prototype to port 8081
3. **Option C - Remove Prototype**: Since main app now has all features, prototype may be redundant

#### Best Practice:
The main app's `AIChatGPTSecure.tsx` now has all the features from both previous implementations. The gemini-prototype can likely be removed unless needed for testing.
